Chapter 11: Blog posts (11a)
============================

A posts table is constructed as a model to support blog posts.  The posts are tied to some author, who
happens to be the User in our case.  We add a foreign key to the User class in order to reference it back
to the author.

The PostForm will let the user enter data.
Attempt to create a timeline for blog posts in the index view.


Chapter 11: Blog posts in profile pages (11b)
=============================================

The list of blog posts for a user is obtained from the User.posts relationship, which is a query object, 
so filters such as order_by() can be used on it as well.
The user.html template requires the <ul> HTML tree that renders a list of blog posts like the one in index.html. 
Having to maintain two identical copies of a piece of HTML is not ideal, so for cases like this, 
Jinja2â€™s include() directive is very useful.


Chapter 11: Generate fake users and posts (11c)
===============================================

As the blog posts grow, there will be too many.  The solution is to paginate and render in chunks.

A development dependency will not be used in production.  To test the blog, you can generate fake users/posts
with forgerypy.  Static methods are set in the User and Post models.  Enter a shell session to add to the db.


Chapter 11: Blog post pagination (11d)
======================================

Pagination is defined in SQLAlchemy

A paginations footer is added with a macro and CSS
