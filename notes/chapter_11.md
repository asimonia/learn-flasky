Chapter 11: Blog posts (11a)
============================

A posts table is constructed as a model to support blog posts.  The posts are tied to some author, who
happens to be the User in our case.  We add a foreign key to the User class in order to reference it back
to the author.

The PostForm will let the user enter data.
Attempt to create a timeline for blog posts in the index view.
